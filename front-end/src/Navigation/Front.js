      Tulcingo is a small town of Puebla in Mexico, but it is also a successful bakery located at 40-11 82nd Street.
      <p />
       Which has been in the neighborhood for about 7 years. After she finished her career in Childhood Education, Michelle Bravo dedicated her time to manage her parents’ business, which has expanded to 3 locations, two in the Bronx and another in Brooklyn.
        <p/>
        “My parents paid for my tuition and it’s time I pay them back for what they invested on me,” tells Michelle with conviction. Every day, Michelle starts her journey with coffee and some traditional Mexican bread, just as many of Tulcingo’s clients who stop by every morning to grab breakfast before they go to work. As they are also a restaurant, the kitchen doesn’t stop from opening at 9 am on, especially at lunch time when people come looking for tacos, tortas, cemitas, burritos and one of their main dishes, molcajetes.
      <p />
      <p />
      Store Hours. 8:00am - 9:00pm daily.
